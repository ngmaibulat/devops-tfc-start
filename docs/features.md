Remote State Management: This is one of the core features of Terraform Cloud. It safely stores the state of your resources and infrastructure and can provide access to this state at any time.

Runs and Workspace Management: It provides a centralized place for your teams to manage and collaborate on Terraform applications. Workspaces in Terraform Cloud align with a set of infrastructure managed by a version of your Terraform code.

Private Module Registry: Terraform Cloud allows you to share modules across multiple configurations within your organization, effectively enabling code reuse across teams.

Collaborative Workflow: Terraform Cloud enables team collaboration. When you make changes to your infrastructure, these changes are visible to your entire team.

Policy as Code: With the Sentinel integration, Terraform Cloud allows you to practice policy as code. You can set policies that each run must pass before it can be applied, ensuring compliance and security.

Secure Variable Storage: Terraform Cloud allows you to define variables for your workspace, and it securely stores sensitive information like cloud credentials.

Integration and APIs: It can be integrated with popular version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. The API lets you create and update settings in Terraform Cloud programmatically.
